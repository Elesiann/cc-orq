## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-21

First public release.

### Added

- A detached job engine. Each job runs a provider CLI (Codex, OpenCode,
  Antigravity or Claude) under its own supervisor and process group, keeps its
  prompt, events, final message and exit code in its own directory, and
  outlives the Claude Code session that started it.
- The `/orq` command: `list`, `result`, `cancel` and `launch`.
- The `cc-orq:task` agent type. A task names its instance and model in a header,
  runs as a job, and returns its answer to the parent session when the job
  ends. The parent's permission mode caps what a task may do, and a driver
  refuses a mode it cannot enforce.
- The MCP tools `capabilities`, `status`, `cancel`, `integrate` and `wait`,
  with the shapes of T3 Code's orchestrator contract.
- Worktree isolation: a task runs in its own git worktree on a new branch by
  default, and `integrate` merges that branch back with `ff-only` or `merge`.
- Child questions: a blocked job writes its question to `question.txt` and
  stops, and the parent answers it in a new task. The OpenCode tool
  `opencode/tools/orq_ask.ts` writes the same file.
- The orchestration instructions, delivered to the parent session by a
  `SessionStart` hook.
- A task card above the prompt, or on the status line, that shows each running
  job's instance, model, status, last action and duration, and the
  `/orq-panel` pane to follow and cancel jobs.
- The `cardDisplay` setting (`band`, `status` or `off`) and the optional
  `~/.config/orq/config.json` for the jobs directory, wait slice, allowed roots
  and provider instances.
